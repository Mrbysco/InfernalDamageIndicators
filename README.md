# Infernal Damage Indicators #

## About ##
Infernal Damage Indicators bridges the gap between [AtomicStryker's Infernal Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atomicstrykers-infernal-mobs) and [ToroHealth Damage Indicators](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/torohealth-damage-indicators) by allowing the HUD to show the names of Infernal mobs and also display their modifiers below the health bar.
